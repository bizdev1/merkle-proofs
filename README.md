# About

Python library allowing creation of Merkle trees and output receipts
in a format consistent with the [chainpoint](https://github.com/chainpoint) v2 standard.

Also allows validation of a Merkle receipt.

This was developed in support of the [Digital Certificates](http://certificates.media.mit.edu/) project.
It supports only a subset of the Chainpoint v2 standard.
